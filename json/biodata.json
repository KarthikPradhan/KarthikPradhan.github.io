    "about_me": "I completed my Masters in Computer Science at the University of Passau, with the focus area Information and Communication Systems. I am an experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the food & beverage industry. I gained interest in Odoo as it is the one-stop solution for all the business needs and it is one of the best open source ERP tools. I have experience in the server and database maintenance, and also in Odoo migration. Not only did I work on the core Odoo ORM framework and Python, but also on Odoo JS which makes me implement things exactly as our staff/clients expect."
